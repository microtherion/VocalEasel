Low Level MIDI Commands
</H1>

<P>
The commands discussed in this chapter directly effect your MIDI
output devices.

<P>
Not all MIDI devices are equal. Many of the effects in this chapter
may be ignored by your devices. Sorry, but that's just the way MIDI
is.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002010000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="set-channel"></A>
<BR>
Channel
</H1> 

<P>
As noted in <A HREF="node3.html#sec-tracks">Tracks and Channels</A> 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  assigns MIDI channels
dynamically as it creates tracks. In most cases this works fine;
however, you can if you wish force the assignment of a specific MIDI
channel to a track with the C<SMALL>HANNEL</SMALL> command.

<P>
You cannot assign a channel number to a track if it already defined
(well, see the section C<SMALL>H</SMALL>S<SMALL>HARE</SMALL>, below, for the inevitable
exception), nor can you change the channel assignments for any of the
D<SMALL>RUM</SMALL> tracks.

<P>
Let us assume that you want the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Bass</SPAN> track assigned to MIDI
channel 8. Simply use:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass Channel 8   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Caution: If the selected channel is already in use an error will be
generated. Due to the way 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  allocates tracks, if you really need
to manually assign track it is recommended that you do this in a
MMA<SMALL>RC</SMALL> file.

<P>
<A NAME="channel0"></A>
<P>
You can disable a channel at any time by using a channel number of 0:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Arpeggio-1 Channel 0  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will disable the Arpeggio-1 channel, freeing it for use by other
tracks. A warning message is generated. Disabling a track without a
valid channel is fine. When you set a channel to 0 the track is also
disabled. You can restart the track with the O<SMALL>N</SMALL> command
(<A HREF="node23.html#set-on">here</A>).

<P>
You don't need to have a valid MIDI channel assigned to a track to do
things like: MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL>, MIDIG<SMALL>LIS</SMALL>, MIDIV<SMALL>OLUME</SMALL> or
even the assignment of any music to a track. MIDI data is created in
tracks and then sent out to the MIDI buffers. Channel assignment is
checked and allocated at this point, and an error will be generated if
no channels are available.

<P>
It's quite acceptable to do channel reassignments in the middle of a
song. Just assign channel 0 to the unneeded track first.

<P>
MIDI channel settings are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> saved in G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>s.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  inserts a MIDI ``track name'' meta event when the channel
buffers are first assigned at a MIDI offset of 0. If the MIDI channel
is reassigned, a new ``track name'' is inserted at the current song
offset.

<P>
A more general method is to use C<SMALL>HANNEL</SMALL>P<SMALL>REF</SMALL> detailed below.

<P>
You can access the currently assigned channel with the
$_TRACK_C<SMALL>HANNEL</SMALL> macro.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002020000000000000000">
ChannelPref</A>
</H1>

<P>
If you prefer to have certain tracks assigned to certain channels you
can use the C<SMALL>HANNEL</SMALL>P<SMALL>REF</SMALL> command to create a custom set of
preferences. By default, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  assigns channels starting at 16 and
working down to 1 (with the expectation of drum tracks which are all
assigned channel 10). If, for example, you would like the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Bass</SPAN>
track to be on channel 9, sustained bass on channel 3, and
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Arpeggio</SPAN> on channel 5, you can have a command like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>ChannelPref Bass=9 Arpeggio=5 Bass-Sus=3   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Most likely this will be in your <SMALL>MMARC</SMALL> file.

<P>
You can use multiple command lines, or have multiple assignments on a
single line. Just make sure that each item consists of a trackname, an
``='' and a channel number in the range 1 to 16.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002030000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="set-chshare"></A>
<BR>
ChShare
</H1> 

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  is fairly conservative in its use of MIDI tracks. ``Out of the
box'' it demands a separate MIDI channel for each of its tracks, but
only as they are actually used. In most cases, this works just fine.

<P>
However, there are times when you might need more tracks than the
available MIDI channels or you may want to free up some channels for
other programs.

<P>
If you have different tracks with the same voicing, it's quite simple.
For example, you might have an arpeggio and scale track:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Arpeggio Sequence A16 z 
<BR>
Arpeggio Voice Piano1 
<BR>
Scale Sequence z S8 
<BR>
Scale Voice Piano1   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In this example, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will use different MIDI channels for the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Arpeggio</SPAN> and the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Scale</SPAN>. Now, if you force channel
sharing:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Scale ChShare Arpeggio  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
both tracks will use the same MIDI channel.

<P>
This is really foolproof in the above example, especially since the
same voice is being used for both. Now, what if you wanted to use a
different voice for the tracks?

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Arpeggio Sequence A16 z 
<BR>
Arpeggio Voice Piano1 Strings 
<BR>
Scale Sequence z S8 
<BR>
Scale ChShare Arpeggio  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
You might think that this would work, but it doesn't. 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  ignores
voice changes for bars which don't have a sequence, so it will set
``Piano1'' for the first bar, then ``Strings'' for the second (so far,
so good). But, when it does the third bar (an A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL>) it will
not know that the voice has been changed to ``Strings'' by the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Scale</SPAN> track.

<P>
So, the general rule for track channel sharing is to use only one
voice.

<P>
One more example which doesn't work:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Arpeggio Sequence A8 
<BR>
Scale Sequence S4 
<BR>
Arpeggio Voice Piano1 
<BR>
Scale Voice Piano1 
<BR>
Scale ChShare Arpeggio   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
This example has an active scale and arpeggio sequence in each
bar. Since both use the same voice, you may think that it will work
just fine ...but it may not. The problem here is that 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will
generate MIDI on and off events which may overlap each other. One or
the other will be truncated. If you are using a different octave, it
will work much better. It may sound okay, but you should probably find
a better way to do this.

<P>
When a C<SMALL>H</SMALL>S<SMALL>HARE</SMALL> directive is parsed the ``shared'' channel is
first checked to ensure that it has been assigned. If not currently
assigned, the assignment is first done. What this means is that you
are subverting 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 's normal dynamic channel allocation scheme. This
may cause is a depletion of available channels.

<P>
Please note that that the use of the C<SMALL>H</SMALL>S<SMALL>HARE</SMALL> command is
probably never really needed, so it might have more problems than
outlined here. If you want to see how much a bother channel sharing
becomes, have a look at the standard library file
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">frenchwaltz.mma</SPAN></TT>. All this so the accordion bass can use one
channel instead of 6. If I were to write it again I'd just let it suck
up the MIDI channels.

<P>
For another, simpler, way of reassigning MIDI tracks and letting 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  do most of the work for you, refer to the
<A HREF="node23.html#sec-delete">D<SMALL>ELETE</SMALL> command</A>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002040000000000000000">
ForceOut</A>
</H1>

<P>
Under normal conditions 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  only generates the MIDI tracks it thinks
are valid or relevant. So, if you create a track but insert no note
data into that track it will not be generated. An easy way to verify
this is by creating file and running 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  with the -c command line
option. Lets start off by creating a file you might think will set the
keyboard channel on your synth to a TenorSax voice:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Begin Solo-Keyboard
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel 1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice TenorSax
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDIVolume 100
<BR>
End  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
If you compile this you should get:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>$ mma test -c
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
File 'test' parsed, but no MIDI file produced!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
Tracks allocated:
<BR>&nbsp;SOLO-KEYBOARD
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
Channel assignments:
<BR>
1 SOLO-KEYBOARD
<BR>  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
So, a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  track was created, but if you compile this file and
examine the resulting MIDI file you will find that the voice <SPAN  CLASS="textit">has
  not</SPAN> been set.

<P>
To overcome this, insert the F<SMALL>ORCE</SMALL>O<SMALL>UT</SMALL> command at the end of the
track setup. For example, here is a more complete file which will set
the keyboard track to TenorSax with a volume of 100, play a bar of
accompaniment, set a Trumpet voice with a louder volume, play another
bar, and finally reset the keyboard to the default Piano voice.

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Groove BossaNova
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
Begin Solo
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel 1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice TenorSax
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDIVolume 100
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ForceOut
<BR>
End
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
1 C
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
Begin Solo
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice Trumpet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDIVolume 120
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ForceOut
<BR>
End
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
2 G
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
Begin Solo
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice Piano1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDIVolume 127
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ForceOut
<BR>
End
<BR>  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Note: The same or similar results could be accomplished with the
MIDI command; however, it's a bit harder to use and the
commands would be in the Meta track.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002050000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec-midi"></A>
<BR>
MIDI
</H1>

<P>
The complete set of MIDI commands is not limitless--but from this end
it seems that adding commands to suit every possible configuration is
never-ending. So, in an attempt to satisfy everyone, a command which
will place any arbitrary MIDI stream in your tracks has been
implemented. In most cases this will be a MIDI ``Sysex'' or ``Meta''
event.

<P>
For example, you might want to start a song off with a MIDI reset:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDI 0xF0 0x05 0x7e 0x7f 0x09 0x01 0xf7  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
The values passed to the MIDI command are normal integers; however,
they must all be in the range of 0x00 to 0xff. In most cases it is
easiest to use hexadecimal numbers by using the ``0x'' prefix. But,
you can use plain decimal integers if you prefer.

<P>
In the above example:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;0xF0</DT>
<DD>Designates a SYSEX message

<P>
</DD>
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;0x05</DT>
<DD>The length of the message

<P>
</DD>
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;0x7e</DT>
<DD>...The actual message

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Another example places the key signature of F major (1 flat) in the
meta track:<A NAME="tex2html66"
  HREF="#foot9027"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">20</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDI 0xff 0x59 0x02 0xff 0x00  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Some <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cautions:</SPAN>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  makes no attempt to verify the validity of the data!

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The ``Length'' field must be manually calculated.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Malformed sequences can create non-playable MIDI files. In extreme
  situations, these might even damage your synth. You are on your own
  with this command ...be careful.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The M<SMALL>IDI</SMALL> directive always places data in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Meta</SPAN>
  track at the current time offset into the file. This should not be a
  problem.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Cautions aside, <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">includes/init.mma</SPAN></TT> has been included in this
distribution. I use this without apparent problems; to use it add the
command line:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MMAstart init  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
in your <SMALL>MMARC</SMALL> file. The file is pretty well commented and it
sets a synth up to something reasonably sane.

<P>
If you need a brief delay after a raw MIDI command, it is possible to
insert a silent beat with the <A HREF="node15.html#beatadjust">B<SMALL>EAT</SMALL>A<SMALL>DJUST</SMALL>
  command</A>.  See
the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">includes/reset.mma</SPAN></TT> for an example.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002060000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="sec-midiclear"></A>
<BR>
MIDIClear
</H1> 

<P>
As noted earlier in this manual you should be very careful in
programming MIDI sequences into your song and/or library files. Doing
damage to a synthesizer is probably a remote possibility ...but
leaving it in a unexpected mode is likely. For this reason the
MIDIC<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL> command has been added as a companion to the
MIDIV<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> and MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> commands.

<P>
Each time a MIDI track (not necessary the same as a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  track) is
ended or a new G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> is started, a check is done to see if any
MIDI data has been inserted in the track with a MIDIV<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> or
MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> command. If it has, a further check is done to see if
there is an ``undo'' sequence defined via a MIDIC<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL> command.
That data is then sent; or, if data has not be defined for the track,
a warning message is displayed.

<P>
The MIDIC<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL> command uses the same syntax as MIDIV<SMALL>OICE</SMALL>
and MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL>; however, you can not specify different sequence
for different bars in the sequence:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass-Funky MIDIClear 1 Modulation 0; 1 ReleaseTime 0  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
As in MIDIV<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> and MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> you can include sequences
defined in a MIDID<SMALL>EF</SMALL>. The &lt;beat&gt;offsets
are required, but ignored.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION002070000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="midismf"></A>
<BR>
MIDIFile
</H1> 

<P>
This option controls some fine points of the generated MIDI file. The
command is issued with a series of parameters in the form
``MODE=VALUE''. You can have multiple settings in a single
MIDIF<SMALL>ILE</SMALL> command.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  can generate two types of SMF (Standard MIDI Files):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0.</DT>
<DD>This file contains only one track into which the data for
  all the different channel tracks has been merged. A number of synths
  which accept SMF (Casio, Yamaha and others) only accept type 0
  files.

<P>
</DD>
<DT>1.</DT>
<DD>This file has the data for each MIDI channel in its own
  track. This is the default file generated by 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> .

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
You can set the filetype in an RC file (or, for that matter, in any
file processed by 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> ) with the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MidiFile SMF=0  </B>

By default

This can be disabled with the command:

        <tr><td>
    <B>MidiFile Running=1  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Files generated without running status will be about 20 to 30% larger
than their compressed counterparts. They may be useful for use with
brain-dead sequencers and in debugging generated code. There is no
command line equivalent for this option.

<P>
When the MIDI<SMALL>INC</SMALL> command is encountered the current line is

<P>
MIDI<SMALL>INC</SMALL> has a number of options, all set in the form
OPTION=VALUE. Following are the recognized options:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>FILENAME</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The filename of the file to be included. This must be
  a complete filename. The filename will be expanded by the Python
  os.path.expanduser() function for tilde expansion. No prefixes or
  extensions are added by 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> . Examples:
  F<SMALL>ILENAME</SMALL>=<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/home/bob/midi/myfile.mid</SPAN></TT>.  or
  F<SMALL>ILENAME</SMALL>=<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">&nbsp;/sounds/myfile.mid</SPAN></TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>VOLUME</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An adjustment for the volume of all the note on events
  in the included MIDI file. The adjustment is specified as a
  percentage with values under 100 decreasing the volume and over 100
  increasing it. If the resultant volume (velocity) is less than 1 a
  velocity of 1 will be used; if it is over 127, 127 will be
  used. Example: V<SMALL>OLUME</SMALL>=80.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>OCTAVE</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Octave adjustment for all notes in the file. Values in
  the range -4 to 4 are permitted. Notes in drum tracks (channel 10)
  will not be effected. Example: O<SMALL>CTAVE</SMALL>=2.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>TRANSPOSE</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Transposition adjustment settings in the range -24 to
  24 are permitted. If you do not set a value for this the global
  transpose setting will be applied (expecting channel 10, drum,
  notes). Example: T<SMALL>RANSPOSE</SMALL>=-2.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>LYRIC</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option will copy any <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Lyric</SPAN> events to the
  
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  meta track. The valid settings are ``On'' or ``Off''. By
  default this is set to ``Off''. Example L<SMALL>YRIC</SMALL>=On.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option will copy any <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Text</SPAN> events to the 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>    meta track. The valid settings are ``On'' or ``Off''. By default
  this is set to ``Off''. Example T<SMALL>EXT</SMALL>=On.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>START</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Specifies the start point <SPAN  CLASS="textit">of the file to be
    included</SPAN> in beats. For example, ``Start=22'' would start the
  include process 22 beats into the file. The data will be inserted at
  the current song position in your MMA file. The value used must
  greater or equal to 0 and may be a fractional beat value (18.456 if
  fine).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>END</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Specifies the end point <SPAN  CLASS="textit">of the file to be included</SPAN>
  in beats. For example, ``End=100'' would discard all data after 100
  beats in the file. The value used must be greater that the
  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Start</SPAN> position and can be fractional.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><SPAN  CLASS="textit">TRACK</SPAN></STRONG></DT>
<DD>A trackname <SPAN  CLASS="textit">must be set</SPAN> into which notes
  are inserted. You can set more than one track/channel if you
  wish. For example, if you had the option <SPAN  CLASS="textit">DRUM=10</SPAN> any notes in
  the MIDI file with a channel 10 setting would be inserted into the
  
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Drum</SPAN> track. Similarity, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Solo-Tenor=1</SPAN> will copy
  notes from channel 1 into the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Solo-Tenor</SPAN> track. If the track
  doesn't exist, it will be created. Note: this means that the channel
  assignment in your included file and the new 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  generated file
  will most likely be different.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">At least one T<SMALL>RACK</SMALL> option is required to include a MIDI

<P>
A complete example of usage is shown in the files in the directory

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDIinc File=test.mid Solo-Piano=1 Drum=10 Volume=70  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will include the MIDI file ``test.mid'' at the current position and
assign all notes in channel 1 to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Solo-Piano</SPAN> track and the
notes from channel 10 to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Drum</SPAN> track. The volumes for all
the notes will be adjusted to 70% of that in the original.

<P>
A few notes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>MIDI files to be included do not have to have the same tempo.
  M<SMALL>IDI</SMALL>I<SMALL>NC</SMALL> adjusts this automatically during the importation.
  However, the internal setting for beat division should be the same.
  
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  assumes a beat division of 192 (this is set in bytes 12 and 13
  of the MIDI file). If the included file differs a warning is printed
  and 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will attempt to adjust the timings.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All files are parsed to find the offset of the first note-on
  event; notes to be included are set with their offsets compensated
  by that time. This means that any silence at the start of the
  included file is skipped (this may surprise you if you have used the
  optional <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Start</SPAN> setting). If you want the included file to
  start somewhere besides the start of the current bar you can use a
  B<SMALL>EATADJUST</SMALL> before the M<SMALL>IDI</SMALL>I<SMALL>NC</SMALL>--use another to move
  the pointer back right after the include to keep the song pointer
  correct.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Not all events in the included files are transferred: notably
  all system and meta events (other than text and lyric, see above)
  are ignored.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you want to apply different V<SMALL>OLUME</SMALL> or other options to
  different tracks, just do multiple includes of the same file (with
  each include using a different track and options).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION0020110000000000000000">
MIDIPan</A>
</H1>

<P>
In MIDI-speak ``pan'' is the same as ``balance'' on a stereo. By
adjusting the MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> for a track you can direct the output to
the left, right or both speakers. Example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass MIDIPan 4   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
This command is only available in track mode. The data generated is
not sent into the MIDI stream until musical data is created for the
relevant MIDI channel.

<P>
The value specified must be in the range 0 to 127, and must be an
integer.

<P>
A variation for this command is to have the pan value change over a
range of beats:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Solo MidiPan 10 120 4  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
in this case you must give exactly 3 arguments:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The initial pan value (0 to 127),
</LI>
<LI>The final pan value (0 to 127),
</LI>
<LI>The number of beats to apply the pan over.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Using a beat count you can create interesting effects with different
instruments moving between the left and right channels. 

<P>
MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> is not saved or restored by G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> commands, nor
is it effected by S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL>C<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL>. A MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> is inserted
directly into the MIDI track at the point at which it is encountered
in the music file. This means that the effect of MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> will
be in use until another MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> is encountered.

<P>
MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> can be used in MIDI compositions to emulate the sound
of an orchestra. By assigning different values to different groups of
instruments, you can get the feeling of strings, horns, etc. all
placed in the ``correct'' position on the stage.

<P>
MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> can be used for much cruder purposes. When creating
accompaniment tracks for a mythical jazz group, you might set all the
bass tracks (Bass, Walk, Bass-1, etc) set to aMIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> 0. Now,
when practicing at home you have a ``full band''; and the bass player
can practice without the generated bass lines simply by turning off
the left speaker.

<P>
Because most MIDI keyboard do not reset between tunes, there should be
a MIDIP<SMALL>AN</SMALL> to undo the effects at the end of the
file. Example:<A NAME="tex2html68"

<P>
The M<SMALL>IDI</SMALL>S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> command is specific to a track and is saved as part
of the G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> definition. This lets style file writers use
enhanced MIDI features to dress up their sounds.

<P>
The command has the following syntax:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>TrackName MidiSeq &lt;Beat&gt; &lt;Controller&gt; &lt;Datum&gt; [ ; ...]   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
where:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Beat</STRONG></DT>
<DD>is the Beat in the bar. This can be an integer (1,2, etc.)
  or a floating point value (1.2, 2.25, etc.). It must be 1 or greater
  and less than the end of bar (in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">4/4</SPAN> it must be less than
  5).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Controller</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A valid MIDI controller. This can be a value in the
  range 0x00 to 0x7f or a symbolic name. See the appendix
  <A HREF="node29.html#sec-controllers">, here,</A> for a list of
  defined names.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Datum</STRONG></DT>
<DD>All controller messages use a single byte ``parameter''
  in the range 0x00 to 0x7f.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
You can enter the values in either standard decimal notation or in
hexadecimal with the prefixed ``0x''. In most cases, your code will be
clearer if you use values like ``0x7f'' rather than the equivalent
``127''.

<P>
The MIDI sequences specified can take several forms:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A simple series like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDISeq 1 ReleaseTime 50; 3 ReleaseTime 0   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
in this case the commands are applied to beats 1 and 3 in each bar
  of the sequence.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION0020121000000000000000">.</A>

</H2>

<P>
As a set of names predefined in an MIDID<SMALL>EF</SMALL> command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDIdef Rel1 1 ReleaseTime 50; 3 ReleaseTime 0 
<BR>
MIDIdef Rel2 2 ReleaseTime 50; 4 ReleaseTime 0 
<BR>
MIDISeq Rel1 Rel2   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Here, the commands defined in ``Rel1'' are applied to the first bar
  in the sequence, ``Rel2'' to the second. And, if there are more bars
  in the sequence than definitions in the line, the series will be
  repeated for each bar.

<P>
A set of series enclosed in { } braces. Each braced series is
  applied to a different bar in the sequence. The example above could
  have been does as:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDISeq { 1 ReleaseTime 50; 3 ReleaseTime 0 }  &#92;
<BR>     { 2 ReleaseTime 50; 4 ReleaseTime 0 }   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Finally, you can combine the above into different combinations.
  For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDIDef Rel1 1 ReleaseTime 50 
<BR>
MIDIDef Rel2 2 ReleaseTime 50  
<BR>
MIDISeq { Rel1; 3 ReleaseTime 0 } { Rel2; 4 ReleaseTime 0 }   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>

<P>
You can have specify different messages for different beats (or
different messages/controllers for the same beat) by listing them on
the same M<SMALL>IDI</SMALL>S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> line separated by ``;''s.

<P>
If you need to repeat a sequence for a measure in a sequence you can
use the special notation ``/'' to force the use of the previous line.
The special symbol ``z'' or ''-'' can be used to disable a bar (or
number of bars). For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass-Dumb MIDISeq 1 ReleaseTime 20 z / FOOBAR   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
would set the ``ReleaseTime'' sequence for the first bar of the
sequence, no MIDISeq events for the second and third, and the contents
of ``FOOBAR'' for the fourth.

<P>
To disable the sending of messages just use a single ``-'':

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass-2 MidiSeq - // disable controllers  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION0020130000000000000000">
MIDISplit</A>
</H1>

<P>
For certain post-processing effects it is convenient to have each
different drum tone in a separate MIDI track. This makes it easier to
apply an effect to, for example, the snare drum. Just to make this a
bit more fun you can split any track created by 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> .

<P>
To use this feature:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDISplit &lt;list of channels&gt;  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
So, to split out just the drum channel<A NAME="tex2html69"
  HREF="#foot8981"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">20</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A> you would have the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MIDISplit 10  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
somewhere in your song file.

<P>
When processing 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  creates an internal list of MIDI note-on events
for each tone or pitch in the track. It then creates a separate MIDI
track for each list. Any other events are written to another track.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION0020140000000000000000">
MIDITname</A>
</H1>

<P>
When creating a MIDI track, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  inserts a MIDI Track Name event at
the start of the track.  By default, this name is the same as the
associated 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  track name. You can change this by issuing the
MIDI<SMALL>T</SMALL>N<SMALL>AME</SMALL> command. For example, to change the C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL>
track name you might do something like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord MidiTname Piano  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Please note that this <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> effects the tracks in the generated
MIDI file.  You still refer to the track in your file as C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION0020150000000000000000">
MIDIVoice</A>
</H1>

<P>
Similar to the MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> command discussed in the previous
section, the MIDIV<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> command is used to insert MIDI
controller messages into your files. Instead of sending the data for
each bar as MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> does, this command just sends the listed
control events at the start of a track and then, if needed, at the
start of each bar.

<P>
Again, a short example. Let us assume that you want to use the
``Release Time'' controller to sustain notes in a bass line:

should give an interesting effect.

<P>
The syntax for the command is:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Track MIDIVoice &lt;beat&gt; &lt;controller&gt; &lt;Datum&gt; [; ...]   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
This syntax is identical to that discussed in the section for
MIDIS<SMALL>EQ</SMALL>, above. The &lt;beat&gt;value is
required for the command--it determines if the data is sent before or
after the V<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> command is sent. Some controllers are reset by
a voice, others not. My experiments show that B<SMALL>ANK</SMALL> should be
sent before, most others after. Using a ``beat'' of ``0'' forces the
MidiVoice data to be sent before the Voice control; any other ``beat''
value causes the data to be sent after the Voice control. In this
silly example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Voice Piano1 
<BR>
MidiVoice {0 Bank 5; 1 ReleaseTime 100}   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
the MIDI data is created in an order like:

<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>0 Param Ch=xx Con=00 val=05 
<BR>
0 ProgCh Ch=xx Prog=00 
<BR>
0 Param Ch=xx Con=72 val=80

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
All the MIDI events occur at the same offset, but the order is (may
be) important.

<P>
By default 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  assumes that the MIDIVoice data is to be used only
for the first bar in the sequence. But, it's possible to have a
different sequence for each bar in the sequence (just like you can
have a different V<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> for each bar). In this case, group the
different data groups with {} brackets:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass-1 MIDIVoice {1 ReleaseTime 50} {1 ReleaseTime 20}   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
This list is stored with other G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> data, so is ideal for
inclusion in a style file.

<P>
If you want to disable this command after it has been issued you can
use the form:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Track MIDIVoice - // disable  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Some technical notes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  tracks the events sent for each bar and will not duplicate
  sequences.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Be cautious in using this command to switch voice banks. If you
  don't switch the voice bank back to a sane value you'll be playing
  the wrong instruments!

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Do use the MIDIC<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL> command
  (<A HREF="#sec-midiclear">(details)</A>) to
  ``undo'' anything you've done via a MIDIV<SMALL>OICE</SMALL> command.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  doesn't set any channel volumes without your knowledge. If you
want to use a set of reasonable defaults, look at the file
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">includes/init.mma</SPAN></TT> which sets all channels other than ``1'' to
``100''. Channel ``1'' is assumed to be a solo/keyboard track and is
set to the maximum volume of ``127''.

<P>
You can set selected MIDIV<SMALL>OLUME</SMALL>s:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord MIDIVolume 55  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will set the Chord track channel. For most users, the use of this
command is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> recommended since it will upset the balance of
the library grooves. If you need a track softer or louder you should
use the volume setting for the track.

<P>
The data generated is not sent into the MIDI stream until musical data
is created for the relevant MIDI channel.

<P>
Caution: If you use the command with A<SMALL>LL</SMALL>T<SMALL>RACKS</SMALL> you should note
that only existing 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  tracks will be effected.

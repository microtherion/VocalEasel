Short usage file for timsplit.py.

This program is used to create a set of wav tracks from a MMA
input file. You need MMA, the input file and timidity. The command:

	  timsplit.py somefile.mma

will create a MIDI file (the name is hardcoded to outfile.mid) and
then create a wav file for each track using timidity. 

Conversion takes a few minutes, depending on the soundfont you're using
and the size of the MIDI file. Be patient.
